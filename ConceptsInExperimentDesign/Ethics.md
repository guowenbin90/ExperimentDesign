## Ethics in Experimentation
Before you run an experiment, it's important to consider the ethical treatments to which you subject your participants. 
Through the mid-20th century, exposure of questionable and clearly unethical research in the social and medical sciences 
spurred the creation of guidelines for ethical treatment of human subjects in studies and experiments. 
While different fields have developed different standards, they still have a number of major points in common:

- Minimize participant risk: Experimenters are obligated to construct experiments that minimize the risks to participants in the study. 
Risk of harm isn't just in the physical sense, but also the mental sense. 
If an experimental condition has potential to negatively affect a participant's emotions or mentality, 
then it's worth thinking about if the risks are really necessary to perform the desired investigation.

- Have clear benefits for risks taken: In some cases, risks may be unavoidable, 
and so they must be weighed against the benefits that may come from performing the study. 
When expectations for the study are not clearly defined, this throws into question the purpose of exposing subjects to risk. 
However, if the benefits are shown to be worth the risks, then it is still possible for the study to be run. 
This often comes up in medicine, where test treatments should show worthy potential against alternative approaches.

- Provide informed consent: Building up somewhat from the previous two points, 
subjects should be informed of and agree to the risks and benefits of participation before they join the study or experiment. 
This is also an opportunity for a participant to opt out of participation. 
However, there are some cases where deception is necessary. 
This might be to avoid biasing the participant's behavior by seeding their expectations, 
or if there is a dummy task surrounding the actual test to be performed. 
In cases like this, it's important to include a debriefing after the subject's participation so that they don't come away from the task feeling mislead.

- Handle sensitive data appropriately: If you're dealing with identifiable information in your study, 
make sure that you take appropriate steps to protect their anonymity from others. 
Sensitive information includes things like names, addresses, pictures, timestamps, 
and other links from personal identifiers to account information and history. 
Collected data should be anonymized as much as possible; surveys and census results are often also aggregated to avoid tracing outcomes back to any one person.

In the formal sciences, an experiment proposal must go through a review board before it can be run, 
to ensure that ethical principles have been followed. 
It's likely that you won't have a review board to submit your designs to prior to running an experiment. 
You'll need to evaluate these principles for yourself or with your colleagues to check for potential ethical issues before going forward with a study design.

One particular point worth further discussion is that of informed consent for web-based experiments. 
It's often the case that when an experiment is run, 
users who are included in an experiment often don't know that they're participating in an experiment. 
If a manipulation carries no risk and is so minor as to be hidden away from the user (e.g. a change in recommendation engine), 
perhaps there is no need for informed consent. And when it comes to bias, 
it's known that peoples' behaviors can change when they know they are under observation. 
In practice, informed consent is often not considered when performing a web experiment.

However, informed consent is still an important ethical principle, 
so there is continuing debate on how to best obtain consent for users of a website. 
One option could be to allow users to opt out of experiment participation, 
with the default user agreement implying consent to participation in unobtrusive experiments. 
An opposing option would only run experiments on users who opt-_in_ to participation, asking the user to set their preference on their initial visit or registration. 
The opt-in approach is more in line with the core idea of informed consent, but also risks fewer users available for testing changes.

## Examples in Experimental Ethics
Here are three studies in the social and medical sciences that are often brought up as examples of violations 
of experimental ethics and progenitors of the movement to establish ethics guidelines and boards:

Tuskegee Syphilis Study: This study was started in 1932, where hundreds of African-American men 
were tracked over the course of up to forty years to study the natural progression of syphilis. 
The subjects were denied treatment, even after the development of effective syphilis treatments like penicillin, 
and there were active steps taken to hide the truth of their conditions and treatments to the subjects.

[Milgram obedience study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment): 
During the mid 1960s, psychologist Stanley Milgram tested to what degree people follow authority figures. 
Participants were asked to administer gradually increasing shocks to an acting confederate participant at the behest of 
a lead experimenter based on mistakes made on a dummy memory test used as a cover story. While no shocks were actually administered, 
the study did bing forth questions on what constitutes adequate debriefing and what level of information and informed consent 
needs to be provided to a participant in a study that includes necessary deceptive elements.

[Stanford Prison Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment): 
This 1971 study conducted by psychologist Philip Zimbardo was built to test the dynamics 
and effects of power differences, using a prison scenario. Study volunteers were divided into prisoner and guard groups
and their dynamics observed; the study had to be ended after less than a week due to the increasingly harsh conditions 
the 'guards' had settled into treating the 'prisoners'. It has since served as a major ground for ethical criticisms, 
violating now-established guidelines around risks to participants and clarity of purpose. There are also methodological criticisms, 
as experimenter biases may have shaped the behavior of the 'guards' group in their interactions with 'prisoners'.
And here's a Techcrunch article discussing the ethics of the 2014-published Facebook study on the impact of changing 
the affect of posts seen on users' feeds to their own posting habits.
