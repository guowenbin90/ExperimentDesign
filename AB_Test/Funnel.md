## Building a Funnel
Before we do anything else, the first thing we should do is specify the objective or goal of our study:

*Revising the structure of the homepage will increase the number of people that download the software and, 
ultimately, the number of people that purchase a license.*

Now, we should think about the activities that a user will take on the site that are relevant to measuring our objective. 
This path or funnel will help us figure out how we will create experimental condition groups and which metrics 
we'll need to track to measure the experiment's effect. To help you construct the funnel, 
here's some information about the way the company's website is structured, and how the software induces users to purchase a license.

The company's website has five main sections:

1. the homepage;
2. a section with additional information, gallery, and examples;
3. a page for users to download the software;
4. a page for users to purchase a license; and
5. a support sub-site with documentation and FAQs for the software.

For the software itself, the website requires that users create an account in order to download the software program. 
The program is usable freely for seven days after download. When the trial period is hit, 
the program will bring up a dialog box that takes the user to the license page. 
After purchasing a license, the user will receive a unique code associated with their site account. 
This code can then be used with the program to register it with that user, and the program can be used thereafter without issue.
