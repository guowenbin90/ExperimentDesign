## Statistical Significance
Let's say that we've collected data for a web-based experiment. In the experiment, we're testing the change in layout of a product information page to see if this affects the proportion of people who click on a button to go to the download page. This experiment has been designed to have a cookie-based diversion, and we record two things from each user: which page version they received, and whether or not they accessed the download page during the data recording period. (We aren't keeping track of any other factors in this example, such as number of pageviews, or time between accessing the page and making the download, that might be of further interest.)

Your objective in this notebook is to perform a statistical test on both recorded metrics to see if there is a statistical difference between the two groups.
## Experiment Size
We can use the knowledge of our desired practical significance boundary to plan out our experiment. By knowing how many observations we need in order to detect our desired effect to our desired level of reliability, we can see how long we would need to run our experiment and whether or not it is feasible.

Let's use the example from the video, where we have a baseline click-through rate of 10% and want to see a manipulation increase this baseline to 12%. How many observations would we need in each group in order to detect this change with power  1‚àíùõΩ=.80  (i.e. detect the 2% absolute increase 80% of the time), at a Type I error rate of  ùõº=.05 ?
